# Hardware

The following are some notes and resources I used to get our [Controller 7000 Single door](https://products.security.gallagher.com/security/global/en/products/access-control-hardware/controller-7000-single-door/p/BVC400011) PoE+ controller with a [T15 Multi Tech Reader](https://products.security.gallagher.com/security/global/en/products/access-control-hardware/readers-and-terminals/t15-multi-tech-reader/p/BVC300480) online with our Command Centre hosted on an AWS EC2 instance.

> [!WARNING]\
> Our setup was completely for demonstration purposes and was never intended for use in a production environment. Please consult a professional for any production setups.

A big thank you to [Gallagher Security](http://security.gallagher.com) for providing the hardware and software for this project.
