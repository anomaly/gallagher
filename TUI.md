# Terminal UI

> The TUI is developed using the superpowers given to Python developers by [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io)

The aim of this TUI is to provide a power console for the Gallagher Ecosystem, which is complimentary to the Gallagher Command Centre and makes use of the Gallagher REST API.

Think of it as the Terminal GUI equivalent of what the command line tool provides i.e batch processing, light weight interfaces for doing powerful things.

## Observations

Command Centre has the View, Report and Configure style interfaces (that we should not mimic).
